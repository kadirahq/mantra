# Directory Layout

In Mantra, we enforce a common directory structure. That's the core part of the maintainability of any app.

NOTE: In this section, we only discuss the client-side directory layout. To learn about how to organize the server-side directory layout, refer to [Appendix B](#sec-Appendix-Server-Side-Directory-Layout).

## Top-Level Directory Structure

All the Mantra-related code stays inside the `client` directory of the app. Inside that, there are usually two directories and one JavaScript file. They are:

```
* configs
* modules
* main.js
```

Let's have a look at each of these in detail.

### configs

This directory contains root-level configurations in your app. Usually, this is a place to put app-wide configurations which are common to all modules.

All JavaScript files in this directory should have a default export function which initiates some tasks and returns something if needed.

NOTE: This is where we usually place [Application Context](#sec-Application-Context) as `context.js`.

### modules

This directory contains one or more modules (in their own directories) in your app. There should be at least a single module, and it's usually named `core`.

This is what is usually inside a module directory:

```
* actions
* components
* configs
* containers
* libs
* routes.jsx
* index.js
```

Let's learn more about these directories and files.

#### actions

This directory contains all [actions](#sec-Actions) in the module. Here's a sample directory layout inside it:

```
* posts.js
* index.js
* tests
    - posts.js
```

`posts.js` is an ES2015 module that exports a JavaScript object with actions. For example, here's a simple action module:

```js
export default {
  create({Meteor, LocalState, FlowRouter}, title, content) {
    //...
  },

  clearErrors({LocalState}) {
    //...
  }
};
```

Then, in the `index.js`, we import all the action modules and aggregate all actions. We give a namespace for each module.

```js
import posts from './posts';

export default {
  posts
};
```

In the above example, we've given `posts` as the namespace for the `posts.js` action module.

NOTE: These namespaces should be unique across the app. That's a responsibility of the module.

In the tests directory, we write tests for each action module with its name. Refer to [Appendix D](#sec-Appendix-File-Naming-Conventions) to learn more about test file naming conventions.

#### components

Components contain [UI components](#sec-React-as-the-UI) of the module. It has a directory layout like this:

```
* layouts.main.jsx
* post.jsx
* style.css
* tests
  - layouts.main.js
  - post.js
```

* All the `.jsx` files in this directory should have a default export. It should be a React class.
* You can have CSS files related to these React components and Meteor will bundle them for you.

Just like in actions, we have a tests directory that contains tests. Refer to [Appendix D](#sec-Appendix-File-Naming-Conventionssec-Appendix-File-Naming-Conventions) for test file naming conventions.

#### containers

This directory contains a set of `.js` files, with each of them representing a single container. Each file should have its default export as a React Container class.

Here's a common directory layout:

```
* post.js
* postlist.js
* tests
    - post.js
    - postlist.js
```

This directory also has a `tests` directory which contain tests. Refer to [Appendix D](#sec-Appendix-File-Naming-Conventions) for test file naming conventions.

#### configs

This directory contains the module-level configurations in your app.

All the JavaScript files in this directory must export a default function which initiates any task and returns something if needed. That function may accept ["Application Context"](#sec-Application-Context) as the first argument.

Here's a simple config file:

```js
export default function (context) {
  // do something
}
```

These configurations can be imported and called when loading the module.

NOTE: Usually, this is where we keep Meteor method stubs which are used for optimistic updates.

#### libs

This directory contains a set of JavaScript files (`.js` or `.jsx`) which exports a set of utility functions. This is also known as [libraries](#sec-Libraries). You may write tests for libraries inside a subdirectory called `tests`.

#### routes.jsx

This is the file containing route definitions of the module. It has a default export which is a function. This is a typical routes definition:

```js
import React from 'react';
import {FlowRouter} from 'meteor/kadira:flow-router';
import {mount} from 'react-mounter';

import MainLayout from '/client/modules/core/components/layout.main.jsx';
import PostList from '/client/modules/core/containers/postlist';

export default function (injectDeps) {
  const MainLayoutCtx = injectDeps(MainLayout);

  FlowRouter.route('/', {
    name: 'posts.list',
    action() {
      mount(MainLayoutCtx, {
        content: () => (<PostList />)
      });
    }
  });
}
```

This default export is called with a function called `injectDeps` while loading the module. The `injectDeps` function can be used to inject dependencies into a React component (or a container) as shown above.

#### index.js

This is the module [definition file](#sec-Module-Definition) of the module. There is no need for this module definition file if there is no need to do any of the following tasks:

* To load routes.
* To define actions.
* To run configurations while loading the module.

Here's a typical module definition:

```js
import methodStubs from './configs/method_stubs';
import actions from './actions';
import routes from './routes.jsx';

export default {
  routes,
  actions,
  load(context) {
    methodStubs(context);
  }
};
```

In the module definition, `.load()` method gets called when the module is loading. So, it's the place to invoke configurations.

### main.js

This is the entry point of a Mantra app. It initializes the application context and loads modules. For that, it uses a utility library called [`mantra-core`](https://github.com/mantrajs/mantra-core).

Here's a sample `main.js` file:

```js
import {createApp} from 'mantra-core';
import initContext from './configs/context';

// modules
import coreModule from './modules/core';
import commentsModule from './modules/comments';

// init context
const context = initContext();

// create app
const app = createApp(context);
app.loadModule(coreModule);
app.loadModule(commentsModule);
app.init();
```
