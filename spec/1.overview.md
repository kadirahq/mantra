# Overview

Mantra is an application architecture for [Meteor](https://www.meteor.com/). With Mantra, we try to achieve two main goals.

**1. High Maintainability**

Maintainability is a key factor for success when working with a large team. We achieve this by unit testing every part of our app, while following standards for everything. Then it's easy to on-board new users and work with teams.

**2. Future Proof**

JavaScript is a land of choices. We have more than one best thing for each problem. It can be hard to tell what’s the best solution now and what will change in the future.

Mantra relies on a set of core principles that will last for a long time. Then, we let others to change as needed.

## What's inside Mantra?

* It has a modern React-based **UI component** layer. 
* It has a place to define business logic in your app. We call them **actions**.
* State management is not provided by Mantra itself, but it allows you to use a wide variety of state managers including Meteor/Tracker, Redux, Rx.js Observables, Promises and nearly anything else.
* It has a way to integrate both states and actions into UI components by composing containers.
* It allows you to inject dependencies.
* It helps you to unit test UI, actions and integrations (containers).
* It has standards on directory layout, file naming and everything else. 

## What Mantra is not?

* It's not an application framework. An application framework takes cares of bundling, network transport, deployment, etc. Mantra uses Meteor as the application framework.
* It's not a boilerplate, even though we have a directory structure. 
* It's not a code generator. We may have a code generation tool, but that's not a core part of Mantra.

## Why a Spec?

Mantra is an application architecture. There will be a lot of stakeholders for mantra including app developers, tool builders, tutorial authors and project managers, so it's very important to have a common standard everyone follows. That's what this specification does.

## Before You Read

This specification is written in a simple language. However, you may feel more comfortable if you have a sound knowledge of the following areas.

* ES2015
* React
* React Containers
* Meteor Basics (Pub/Sub, Tracker, ReactiveDict, etc.)
