# Overview

Mantra is an application architecture for [Meteor](https://www.meteor.com/). With Mantra, we are trying to achieve two main goals.

**1. Maintainability**

Maintainability is a key factor for success when working with a large team. We achieve this by unit testing every part of our app, while following standards for everything. Then it's easy to onboard new users and work with teams.

**2. Future Proof**

JavaScript is a land of choices. We have more than one best solution for each problem. It can be hard to tell what’s the best solution now and what will change in the future.

Mantra relies on a set of core principles that will last for a long time. Then, we allow others to change as needed.

## What's Inside Mantra?

* It has a modern, React-based **UI component** layer.
* It has a place to define business logic in your app. We call them **actions**.
* State management is not provided by Mantra itself, but it allows you to use a wide variety of state managers, including Meteor/Tracker, Redux, Rx.js Observables, Promises, and nearly anything else.
* It has a way to integrate both states and actions into UI components by composing containers.
* It allows you to inject dependencies.
* It helps you to unit test UI, actions, and integrations (containers).
* It has standards for directory layout, file naming, and everything else.

## What is Mantra Not?

* It's not an application platform. An application platform takes care of bundling, network transport, deployment, etc. Mantra uses Meteor as the application platform.
* It's not a boilerplate, even though we have a directory structure.
* It's not a code generator. We may have a code-generation tool, but that's not a core part of Mantra.

## What is Mantra?

* It's a set of standards for how to architect a Meteor app.
* It also comes with a set of curated libraries that help you implement Mantra on top of Meteor.

## Why a Spec?

Mantra is an application architecture. There will be a lot of stakeholders for Mantra, including app developers, tool builders, tutorial authors, and project managers, so it's very important to have a common standard everyone follows. That's what this specification does.

## Before You Read

This specification is written in a simple language. However, you may feel more comfortable if you have a sound knowledge of the following areas.

* ES2015
* React
* React Containers
* Meteor Basics (Pub/Sub, Tracker, ReactiveDict, etc.)

Refer to [Appendix A](#sec-Appendix-Prerequisite) to learn more about the above areas.
