# Core Components

Here are the core components of Mantra.

## Client Side Focus

Mantra is an application architecture for the client side of your app. There are a few reasons for that.

* That's because it's the place where you develop your app most of the time.
* In the future, when interacting with the server, you do it with a schema and you've no idea of what's inside the server.
* Mantra [does not believe in Universal Apps](https://voice.kadira.io/say-no-to-isomorphic-apps-b7b7c419c634#.hogcs5r24), but multiple apps for different platforms with code sharing. Then it's common to have a single server to interact with a few client apps.

So based on above factors, it's not a good idea to mix client and server code together. That's why Mantra is client side apps.

However, still most of the apps will be a server side components. Even though Mantra is for the client side, we can follow similar concepts to organize the server side components.

For that, refer [Appendix B](#)

## ES2015 Syntax and ES2015 Modules

We rely on different features of ES2015 and its module system. In order to use Mantra, you need to use [Meteor 1.3](https://forums.meteor.com/t/meteor-1-3-early-beta-now-available/14723), which comes with an implementation of the ES2015 module system.

## React as the UI

We use React as the UI (presentation) layer in Mantra. You should pass all the data, event handlers and library functions via props.

You could handle the React state inside a component, but that should not interact with the rest of your app. Therefore, Mantra highly recommends you avoid using states.

When writing your UI components, you can include any other React component. Here are a few places you can import React components:

* Other UI components you define in your app
* UI components from NPM (like material-ui)
* Any Containers in your app (we'll talk about this in a moment)

Any other thing to the component should be passed via props.

## Actions

Actions are the place where you write the **business logic** in your app. This includes:

* Validations
* State Management
* Interacting with Remote Data Sources

An action is a simple function that accepts the first argument as the whole [application context](#sec-Application-Context) in your app. Other arguments usually come when invoking them from the UI or inside the container.

Note: Inside an action, everything you do should be based on applications context and other arguments passed to the action. You should not require other modules or use Global variables inside actions or the module action stays.

[Click here to see some actions in Mantra](https://github.com/mantrajs/mantra-sample-blog-app/tree/master/client/actions)

## State Management

In an app, we need to deal with different kinds of states. We can divide them into two different categories:

1. Local State - State in the client-side app that will never be synced with a remote server (Errors, validation messages, current page)
2. Remote State - This is the state usually fetched from a remote server and synced with it.

We have different solutions to manage states in our app, including:

* Meteor/MiniMongo (Remote State)
* Tracker/ReactiveDict (Local State)
* FlowRouter (Local State)
* Redux (Local State)
* GraphQL/Lokka (Remote State)
* GraphQL/Relay (Remote State)
* Falcor (Remote State)

This is the place where a lot of innovation is happening in the JavaScript community. So, Mantra is flexible when it comes to state management. You can use anything you want.

For example, you can use the following for your app when starting:

* Meteor/MiniMongo (Remote State)
* Tracker/ReactiveDict (Local State)
* FlowRouter (Local State)

Later on you can move on to different solutions.

Note: However, Mantra enforces a few rules when managing your states.

* Any write operations to states should be done inside an action
* You can read states in both actions and containers
* You should not read or write into states directly inside UI components. UI components should know nothing about states in your app.

See the following links for some sample usage of states:

* [Reading from local state - inside a container](https://github.com/mantrajs/mantra-sample-blog-app/blob/master/client/containers/newpost.js#L8)
* [Writing into local state - inside an action](https://github.com/mantrajs/mantra-sample-blog-app/blob/master/client/actions/posts.js#L7)
* [Reading from a remote state - inside a container](https://github.com/mantrajs/mantra-sample-blog-app/blob/master/client/containers/postlist.js#L8)

## Containers

Containers are the integration layer in Mantra. They do the following:

* pass states into UI components
* pass actions into UI components
* pass any configuration item or library function in the application context

A container is a React component, but you are not directly creating it. You should not use JSX inside the container module.

Containers are normally composed using a library like [react-komposer](https://github.com/kadirahq/react-komposer). It supports different data sources, including Meteor/Tracker, Promises, Rx.js Observable and nearly anything else.

Normally, inside a container you need to write the following functions:

* composer functions to get data from states
* mapper function to get data from dependency injection layer and map it to props

We have some rules for this:

* All these function should be exported from the container module
* Composer functions should only use variables coming via props
* The mapper function should only use variables coming as arguments. It has access to your whole application context and actions.

Note: If you need to pass the application context to a component, do it via props using a mapper.

[Click here to see some containers in Mantra](https://github.com/mantrajs/mantra-sample-blog-app/tree/master/client/containers)

## Application Context

Application Context is available to all the actions and containers, so this is the place for shared variables in your app. These include:

* Meteor namespace
* Meteor Collections
* LocalState
* FlowRouter
* Any other Meteor package
* Redux Stores
* Lokka Client
* Rest Client

[Click here for a sample application context in Mantra](https://github.com/mantrajs/mantra-sample-blog-app/blob/master/client/configs/context.js)

## Dependency Injection

Mantra uses dependency injection to isolate different parts of your app including UI components and actions.

We use a project called [`react-simple-di`](https://github.com/kadirahq/react-simple-di) that uses React Context behind the scene. It accepts both application context and actions as dependencies.

Once configured, application context will be injected into each action. That's the first argument of an action. So, you don't need to pass the application context manually.

It can be access within "Containers" as well.

### Configuring Dependency Injections

Dependencies will be injected to the top-level components in your app. This could be a Layout component.

## Routing & Component Mounting

Note: Here, when referring to components, we will consider both containers and UI components.

We normally use a Router to mount components into the UI. There could be multiple solutions (for example, FlowRouter and React Router).

The Router's only functionality in Mantra is to mount components to the UI. It's just a tool.

Click [here](https://github.com/mantrajs/mantra-sample-blog-app/blob/master/client/configs/routes.jsx) to see how you can use FlowRouter and React Layout to mount components.

## Libraries

Every app has some utility functions to do different tasks. You can also get them via NPM. In Mantra, libraries should be provided to any part of your app via the application context. For that, we can have a field called `libs` that contains all of them.

## Testing

Testing is a core part of Mantra. Mantra helps you to test every part of your application. Rules we've enforced help you to write those tests. You can use familiar tools like Mocha, Chai and Sinon to do testing.

With Mantra, you can unit test three core parts in your app:

* UI components - [Example](https://github.com/mantrajs/mantra-sample-blog-app/blob/master/client/components/post/tests/index.js)
* Actions - [Example](https://github.com/mantrajs/mantra-sample-blog-app/blob/master/client/actions/tests/posts.js)
* Container composers and deps mappers - [Example](https://github.com/mantrajs/mantra-sample-blog-app/blob/master/client/containers/tests/post.js)

### UI Testing

XXX: Update links
For the UI testing we use [enzyme](https://github.com/airbnb/enzyme). Click here to see some sample test cases.

### Mantra Modules

Mantra follows a modular architecture. All the components of Mantra expect "Application Context" should reside inside a module. This includes routing code as well.

You can create as many as modules you like and communicate between them via imports.

### Application Context & Modules

Application Context is the core of the application. It needs to be defined in a place which is not belong to any module. All the modules could access Application Context as a dependency and modules should not update the Application Context.

### Module Definition

Mantra module should contains a definition file it expose actions, routes and accept application context. It is the `index.js` file of a module.

A simple module definition looks like this:

```js
export default {
  // optional
  load(context, actions) {
    // do any module initialization
  },
  // optional
  actions: {
    myNamespace: {
      doSomething: (context, arg1) => {}
    }
  },
  // optional
  routes(injectDeps) {
    const InjectedComp = injectDeps(MyComp);
    // load routes and put `InjectedComp` to the screen.
  }
};
```
TODO: Make all above optional in mantra-core

### Module Actions (Optional)

A module need to expose actions via namespaces. These namespaces are global and module should take responsibility to make it unique. A module can expose different namespaces.

Finally, all these namespaces from each module merged and can be accessible from any Container.

### Module Containers & Components

Module containers and components should be able to import via ES2015 modules.

### Routes

For routing as mentioned earlier, we could use any router library. It's okay to have route definitions inside multiple modules if needed. But it's clear if routes are defined in a single module.

### Core Module

Mantra is 100% modular and there should at least one module in an app. We call this the core module. It's just a simple module but it loads before any other module. This module is the best place to put

* routes,
* configuration,
* libraries,
* actions

and other application specific code.

### Other Module

Then you can have other modules for different parts of your app. It's hard to tell how to group modules for an app. But, it's common to group it by feature wise.

> When you are building modules, makes sure you don't misuse them and create too many modules.

### Sub Modules

Inside a module, you can't have sub modules. This is a decision taken to prevent unnecessary complexity to the app. Otherwise, it's possible to write multiple layers of nested modules and that's very hard to manage.

## Single Entry Point

In Mantra, we want the app to be predictable. Therefore, there is only a single entry point in your app. Usually, it will load routes.
